## 2. Spelling Rules for CVC Words

### Rule 1: Doubling the final consonant
- If a **CVC word** ends with a single vowel + consonant and you add a **suffix starting with a vowel** (like `-ing` or `-ed`), **double the final consonant**.  
- **Examples:**
  - `run` → `running`  
  - `sit` → `sitting`  
  - `hop` → `hopped`, `hopping`  

**Exceptions:**
- Do **not** double if the last consonant is `w`, `x`, or `y`:  
  - `fix` → `fixing`  
  - `play` → `playing`  

### Rule 2: Dropping the final 'e'
- If the word ends with an **e**, drop it before adding a vowel suffix:  
  - `make` → `making`  
  - `write` → `writing`  
  - `dance` → `dancing`  

### Rule 3: Changing 'y' to 'i'
- If a word ends with a consonant + 'y' and you add a suffix:  
  - **Change 'y' to 'i'** before most suffixes (except `-ing`):  
    - `study` → `studies`  
    - `carry` → `carried`  
  - Keep the 'y' when adding `-ing`:  
    - `study` → `studying`  
    - `carry` → `carrying`

## 3. Present Simple

### Use
- To talk about **habits, routines, facts, and general truths**.  
- Often used with time expressions: `always`, `usually`, `every day`, `sometimes`.

### Form
| Subject       | Form           | Example                       |
|---------------|----------------|-------------------------------|
| I/You/We/They | base verb      | I play football.             |
| He/She/It     | base + s/es    | She plays football.          |

**Rules for adding -s/-es:**
- Add `-s`: most verbs → `He eats`, `She runs`  
- Add `-es` if verb ends with: `ch`, `sh`, `s`, `x`, `z` → `watch` → `watches`  

**Negative and Question Forms:**
- Negative: `do/does + not + base verb`  
  - I do not (don't) like pizza.  
  - He does not (doesn't) like pizza.  
- Question: `do/does + subject + base verb`  
  - Do you like pizza?  
  - Does he like pizza?  

### Examples
- I read books every night.  
- She watches TV after school.  
- They do not eat meat.

## 4. Present Progressive (Present Continuous)

### Use
- Actions happening **right now** or **around the present**.  
- Future plans can also use it:  
  - `I am meeting my friend tomorrow.`

### Form
- **am / is / are + verb-ing**
| Subject       | Form Example             |
|---------------|-------------------------|
| I             | am + verb-ing → I am reading. |
| He/She/It     | is + verb-ing → She is cooking. |
| We/They       | are + verb-ing → They are playing football. |

### Spelling Rules with -ing
1. **CVC doubling rule:** double the final consonant  
   - `run` → `running`  
   - `sit` → `sitting`  
2. **Drop final 'e':**  
   - `write` → `writing`  
   - `make` → `making`  
3. **'ie' → 'y':**  
   - `die` → `dying`  

### Examples
- I am reading a book right now.  
- She is studying for her exam.  
- They are playing outside.  
- We are making a cake.
